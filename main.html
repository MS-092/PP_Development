	<title>Neural Style Transfer Algorithm Live works</title>
	<h1>Home</h1>
	<h2>Introduction to my project</h2>
	<p>
		Program about neural style transfer
		This program is able to combine 2 different images into a single one
		With condition of a content and style image of combination
	</p>

	<p>Figure 1: Example picture of the structure between content and style and stylized content images/results</p>

	<h2>
		Global Context Connections
	</h2>
	<p>
		Chosen global context is about personal and cultural expressions
		Because of the representative images from the stylized content image
	</p>

	<h1>Product</h1>
	<h2>
		Advantage and Disadvantage of High Quality process and fast process implementations
	</h2>
	<p>
		Fast process:
		Advantage is that the fast processing from the name itself, it's much faster to process the AI
		Disadvantage is that the final result/stylized content image is not better or the same as the high-quality process
		
		High quality process:
		Advantage is that the result of the image/stylized content image will have better quality result
		Disadvantage is that the users need to take more time to wait for the proess is finished
	</p>

	<!-- Product/Model of the AI 
	For the AI model, it needs to be used tensorflowjs implementation from python code
	Tensorflowjs implementation, with javascript and JSON file integrations
	-->

	<p>
		The inputs are above and there are 2 boxes, 
		First is the input images for the content image. The stylized content image will have based picture from the content image

		Second is the input images for the style image. The stylized content image will have theme or aesthethics based picture from the style image
	</p>
